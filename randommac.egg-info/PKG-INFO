Description: # randommac
        
        A MAC changer for Linux with Network Manager support
        
        ## macchanger and the NetworkManager problem
        
        As I searched the Internet for MAC spoofing solutions, it appeared that the main tool available for Linux (*macchanger*) breaks when *NetworkManager* is used for monitoring of the connections, which is the default on for example Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I do not want to disable *NetworkManager* so I needed to find a way to do spoofing on Linux with it.
        
        *NetworkManager* can be controlled from command line through its utility *nmcli*. *nmcli* supports MAC spoofing through the *cloned-mac-address* option. Therefore, I wrote a few Python wrappers to help me use nmcli for performing flexible MAC spoofing
        
        ## randommac code structure
        
        - /data/ contains an OUI.list file that is used for generating valid random MAC addresses with valid manufacturer ID.
        - /randommac/ contains the code. Interaction with the code should rely on functions from randommac_interface.py for use as a Python module, or randommac for use as a command line tool.
        - /examples/ contains examples of how to use the Python module. You can start by testing the random MAC number generation (python_compute_random_MAC.py), then create new dummy spoofed connections (python_new_spoofed_connection.py), inspect it (python_inspect_connection.py) and spoof it again (python_spoof_existing_connection.py). You can also have a look at the interactive interface (python_interactive_interface.py).
        
        ## installation
        
        Simply clone this repository on you local computer.
        
        ## quick start
        
        For a quick step-by-step demonstration of the module, try the interactive interface. Launch by executing examples/python_interactive_interface.py
        
        ## To do
        
        This is a work in progress.
